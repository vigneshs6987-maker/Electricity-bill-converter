# Electricity-bill-converter
The Electricity Bill Converter is a simple Java-based application that calculates the total electricity bill amount based on the number of units consumed by a customer. The system accepts user input such as customer ID, customer name, and electricity units used, and then applies predefined tariff rates to generate the final bill.
